# Problem Explanation

**Fuel Station Context**

A fuel station serves three types of vehicles based on their fuel requirements:

* Diesel
* Petrol
* Electric

Each fuel type has a limited number of parking slots designated exclusively for it. Vehicles can be fueled only in their respective fuel type slots. The system must manage these slots efficiently, ensuring that vehicles are fueled only when appropriate slots are available.

**Specific Requirements**

* **Initialization:**
    * The `FuelStation` class is initialized with a specific number of slots for each fuel type (diesel, petrol, electric).
* **Operations:**
    * **Fueling a Vehicle (`fuel_vehicle`)**:
        * When a vehicle arrives, it requests fueling based on its fuel type.
        * If a slot for that fuel type is available, the vehicle is fueled, and the number of available slots for that type decreases by one.
        * If no slot is available, the fueling request is denied.
    * **Releasing a Fuel Slot (`open_fuel_slot`)**:
        * Once a vehicle leaves after fueling, the slot becomes available again.
        * If an attempt is made to release a slot when all slots of that fuel type are already empty (no vehicles are currently fueled), the operation is denied.

**Example Scenario**

Given the following sequence of operations:

```python
fuel_station = FuelStation(diesel=2, petrol=2, electric=1)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("diesel")    # -> True (1 diesel slot now occupied)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("petrol")    # -> True (1 petrol slot now occupied)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("diesel")    # -> True (2 diesel slots now occupied)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("electric")  # -> True (1 electric slot now occupied)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("diesel")    # -> False (no diesel slots available)
fuel_station.open_fuel_slot("diesel")  # -> True (1 diesel slot now available)
fuel_station.fuel_vehicle("diesel")    # -> True (2 diesel slots now occupied)
fuel_station.open_fuel_slot("electric")# -> True (1 electric slot now available)
fuel_station.open_fuel_slot("electric")# -> False (no electric slots occupied)
```

**Solution Approach**

To properly manage the fuel slots for different vehicle types, we can employ a straightforward yet effective strategy using Python's built-in data structures.

**Key Components:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * **Dictionary (Dict[str, int])**: We are using a dictionary to map each fuel type ("diesel", "petrol", "electric") to its current number of available slots. This allows for O(1) time complexity for both lookup and update operations.

* **Class Design:**
    * **FuelStation Class:**
        * **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Sets up the fuel station with the specified number of slots for each fuel type.
        * **`fuel_vehicle` Method**: Attempts to fuel a vehicle by checking slot availability.
        * **`open_fuel_slot` Method**: Releases a slot when a vehicle leaves after fueling.

**Operational Logic:**

* **Fueling a Vehicle (`fuel_vehicle`)**:
    * **Check Availability:** Verify if there's at least one available slot for the requested fuel type.
    * **Update Slots:** If available, decrement the slot count and return `True`.
    * **Reject Request:** If not available, return `False`.

* **Releasing a Fuel Slot (`open_fuel_slot`)**:
    * **Check Occupancy:** Ensure that at least one slot of the specified fuel type is currently occupied (available slots are less than the total slots initialized).
    * **Update Slots:** If a slot is occupied, increment the available slot count and return `True`.
    * **Reject Release:** If all slots are already available, return `False`.

**Advantages of This Approach:**

* **Efficiency:** Utilizing a dictionary ensures constant-time operations for slot management.
* **Scalability:** The system can easily accommodate additional fuel types or slot adjustments.

# Problem Explanation

**Specific Problem**

* **Input:** A sequence of strings accompanied by their respective timestamps. The timestamps are provided in chronological order, but multiple strings can share the same timestamp.
* **Objective:** Design a system (DataStream class) that processes this stream and decides whether to print a given string based on the following rule:
    * **Rule:** A unique string should be printed at most once every 5 seconds. If a string is printed at timestamp t, it should not be printed again until timestamp t + 5 seconds or later.

**Example INput**

* **Input Sequence:**
    * (0, "hello") → Should print (True)
    * (1, "world") → Should print (True)
    * (6, "hello") → Should print (True) because 6 - 0 >= 5
    * (7, "hello") → Should not print (False) because 7 - 6 < 5
    * (8, "world") → Should print (True) because 8 - 1 >= 5
* **Output:** [True, True, True, False, True]

**Solution Approach**

To efficiently determine whether to print a string based on the 5-second rule, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the last timestamp each unique string was printed.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a DataStream class with an internal dictionary to store the last printed timestamp for each string.
2. **Processing (should_output_data_str method):**
    * **Check:** When a new string arrives with its timestamp:
        * If the string hasn't been printed before, print it and record the timestamp.
        * If it has been printed, check if the difference between the current timestamp and the last printed timestamp is 5 or more.
            * If yes, print it and update the timestamp.
            * If no, do not print it.
    * **Return:** The method returns True if the string should be printed and False otherwise.

**My Approach**

* **Efficiency:** Using a dictionary allows O(1) time complexity for both insertion and search.
* **Space:** The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of unique strings.
